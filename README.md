Dwelve into the HTML caves to find treasure! First project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This was my first time really customizing an HTML page using CSS and JavaScript. The page is designed as a long, scrolldown adventure as you watch an adventurer dwelve into the caves to find treasure. This project took a lot of time due to drawing the long, vertical background/images, but it also taught me a lot about Photoshop regarding creating animation gifs and gradient tools/layer management. This was my first experience with JavaScript as well, as I learned how to create a random function when clicking on a HTML button that sends you a random image in a different HTML page.
